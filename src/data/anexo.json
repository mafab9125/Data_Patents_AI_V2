    "Resumen":"The invention is directed to manufacturing fertilizers having commercial levels of nitrogen reacted with organic substances. The process comprises treatment of organics with acid that acidifies and heats a mix causing the hydrolysis of polymers. The acidified organic mix is injected sequentially with a nitrogen base under conditions that result in a partially neutralized melt. The sterilized and liquefied organic matter is disbursed over recycled material for production of granules in a granulator before final drying. The process is green scalable, and safe for the location of community organics processing facilities in locations without generating a nuisance to local communities. Fertilizers also provide a green, dual nitrogen-release profile when applied to crops releasing a bolus of nitrogen over one to two weeks following application followed by a continued slow or enhanced efficiency release of nitrogen over a growing season.",

    "Resumen":"The invention describes a new method for treating sludge, which can result in the production of high nitrogen organically-augmented inorganic fertilizer that incorporates municipal sludges or biosolids or organic sludges that can compete with traditional fertilizers such as ammonium phosphate, ammonium sulfate and urea on the commodity fertilizer marketplace. The method takes advantage of the thixotropic property of dewatered biosolids or organic sludge to create a pumpable paste-like material from the biosolids or organic sludge that is then treated with an oxidizer to reduce odorant effects and an acid. This mix is then interacted with concentrated sulfuric and or phosphoric acids and an ammonia source or alternatively a hot or molten melt or salt of ammonium sulfate\/phosphate to form a fertilizer mix. The present invention controls the heat, atmospheric pressure and retention time of the fertilizer mix in the reaction vessel. When a fertilizer melt is formed ammoniation is subsequently completed by the specific use of vaporized ammonia. The invention can also be an add-on to commercial production of ammonium salts. The fertilizer produced by the present invention contains more than 8 wt. % nitrogen and preferably 15 wt. % nitrogen. The invention is oriented to be tailored to the biosolids production for individual municipal waste treatment plants in order to keep the fertilizer manufacturing plants of the present invention small with a minimization of logistics and liability.",

The process involves conditioning traditional waste-water biosolids and processing the conditioned biosolids continuously in a high throughput manufacturing facility. The exothermic design and closed loop control of the primary reaction vessel decreases significantly the amount of power necessary to run a manufacturing facility. The process utilizes green technologies to facilitate decreased waste and enhanced air quality standards over traditional processing plants. The fertilizer produced from recovered biosolid waste is safe and meets or exceeds the United States Environment Protection Agency (USEPA) Class A and Exceptional Quality standards and is not subject to restrictions or regulations.",

Although the cellulose degradation capacity is weakened at 30\u00b0 C., the degradation amplitude is not large, and meanwhile, a KY240 strain also has potassium and inorganicphosphorus degradation capacity, and is expected to be used for preparing a bacterial fertilizer for degrading cellulose, promoting straw decomposition and improving soil fertility, particularly improving the amount of potassium and phosphorus available for plants in soil.",

Microbial organic fertilizer was produced from this biocontrol strain and organic compost. In this fertilizer, the content of the strain is above 1 \u00d7 10 8 cfu\/g, the content of total nitrogen is 3~5% (above 90% of the nitrogen is organic nitrogen), total nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium nutrient is 6~10% and organic matter is 30~35%. As indicated by the experiments, after this microbial organic fertilizer is applied to soil, it will enable rapid multiplication of biocontrol strain into a dominant microflora in the soil and achieve more than 85% of biocontrol rate of wilt in the soil suffering from serious cucumber and watermelon wilt. If this microbial organic fertilizer is applied to the soil without continuous cropping obstacle for a long time, its controlling rate of cucumber and watermelon wilt will be above 80%.",

    "Resumen":"An insecticide organic fertilizer composition eradicates insects such as imported fire ants (IFA). The insecticide organic fertilizer composition comprises an aqueous homogenized manure extract having an active ingredient, a surfactant, a solvent, and a fatty acid. Active ingredients include botanical insecticides which are subject to degradation after a preselected period of time upon delivery to a soil area. The botanical insecticide is selected from the group consisting of rotenone, pyrethrum, sabadilla (varatrine), neem (azadirachtin), ryania (ryanodine), and mixtures thereof, with rotenone being the preferable botanical insecticide selected. Advantageously, the combination of these components and component amounts renders the botanical insecticide's active ingredients, including rotenone, stable in the aqueous organic manure extract for a predetermined period of time. During this predetermined period of time, the insecticide organic fertilizer composition biologically interferes with IFA's pheromone distress signals. Upon application of the insecticide organic fertilizer composition to an IFA mound, the IFAs began to exhibit a state of sluggishness and gradually begin to die over time rather than relocating, effectuating effective eradication after treatment. In addition, the biotanical insecticide functions to fertilize and nourish soil near the vicinity of the mound.",
